Filtering Data Connector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subscribers are sometimes interested only in subset of the data being published
in the system. For instance, we may want to receive updates only if a certain
threshold is reached. For this purpose, DDS provides a QoS settings to configure
which data should be received by subscribers. In this example we will learn:

- How to filter data by their content
- How to specify a minimum separation between updates 


Running the example:
--------------------

- Run the console (Subscriber application)
	./console.py

- Run ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py

- Verify that you receive all the sensor updates


Content filter
-------------

- Copy the following text under the <data_reader> tagin Tutorial.xml

	<filter name="TempThreshold" kind="builtin.sql">
	  <expression> value > 50 </expression>
	</filter>

- Restart the console and spot the differences 

Time Based Filtering
--------------------

- Copy the following text inside the datareader_qos tag in Tutorial.xml. 
  Remember to remove the text added in the previous exercise

	<time_based_filter>
	  <minimum_separation>
	    <sec>5</sec>
  	  </minimum_separation>
	</time_based_filter>

- Restart the console and spot the differences
