Basic Publish Subscribe with Connector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we are going to learn the basics of publish subscribe with DDS. 
We will go learn the following concepts:

- How to publish and to subscribe to data
- Change the QoS settings 

Running the example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Run the console (Subscriber application)
	./console.py

- Run ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py

- Run another sensor instance with a different identifier
	./sensor.py --id 1


Note: If you want to execute your examples in a different Domdin ID change the domain_id attribute
on Tutorial.xml to a different integer value.

Read vs. Take
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default our example uses the take API to get the samples from the middleware. 
In this mode the samples are removed from the local cache

- Exchange take() with read() in console.py

- Add the following lines INSIDE the datareader_qos tag in Tutorial.xml
   ...
   <datareader_qos>
        <history>
	   <depth>10</depth>
	</history>
   <datareader_qos>

- Spot the differences :)
