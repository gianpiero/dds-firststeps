Basic Publish Subscribe with Connector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Run the console (Subscriber application)
	./console.py

- Run ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py

- Run another sensor instance with a different identifier
	./sensor.py --id 1


Read vs. Take
-------------
By default our example uses the take API to get the samples from the middleware. 
In this mode the samples are removed from the local cache


- Exchange take() with read() in console.py
- Add the following lines INSIDE the datareader_qos tag in Tutorial.xml
   ...
   <datareader_qos>
        <history>
	   <depth>10</depth>
	</history>
   <datareader_qos>

- Spot the differences :)
