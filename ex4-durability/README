Late joiners
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In certain scenarios a suscriber application might be interested of receiving 
samples that were sent before starting. Another case is when the subscriber application
crashed and wants to restart from the latest state. This can be achieved by using the 
'durability' and 'history' QoS.

In this example, we are going to show how to receive samples that were 
published before the subscriber application. For this purpose we will learn:

- How to use the reliability, history and durability QoS to implement late-joiner notification


Run the example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Run a ./sensor (Publisher application)
	./sensor.py --id 0

- Wait for 10 seconds and run the console (Subscriber application)
	./console.py

- Look at the behavior. Only the samples that are sent after starting the application
  were received.

- Uncomment the code under datareader_qos and datawriter_qos. 
  Restart the publisher and subscriber. Remember to wait 10 seconds after starting the publisher
  to start the subscriber

- Look at the behavior

- Try changing history kind to KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS and history/depth to 10
What are the differences?
